# Scrapping aggregated Linkedin data using Python


This repository uses Python's Selenium package (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to scrap aggregated alumini data off of LinkedIn into a csv file. The package Selenium provides the ability scrap data from a web site.

This is an introductory repository to help Python users learn about the basics of (a) webscraping, (b) "for" loops for parsimonious code, and (c) working with / exporting nested dictionaries. This repository uses chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to complete its task.
